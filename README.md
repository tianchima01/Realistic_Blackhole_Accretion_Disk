# Realistic_Blackhole_Accretion_Disk
A program which could generate highly realistic accretion disk around a Schwarzschild blackhole

There are two major files and you are free to use any of them:

**Blackhole Accretion Disk_Continuous Disk.nb**: This file is newer, works with Schwarzchild blackholes, JMN-1 naked singularity and possibly other scenarios. I thought I fixed some bugs in the old code. It generates something like this:

![Schwarzchild blackhole](https://github.com/wjxway/image-storage/blob/master/image_tot_sch.png?raw=true)
![JMN-1 naked singularity @ rb=2.0rs](https://github.com/wjxway/image-storage/blob/master/image_tot.png?raw=true)

Where the accretion disk is continuous.

**Blackhole Accretion Disk.nb**: This file is older and works for Schwarzchild blackholes exclusively. It generates something like this:
![Schwarzchild blackhole](https://github.com/wjxway/image-storage/blob/master/With%20All%20Effects.png?raw=true)
Where accretion disk is composed using lines, and the length of the line reflects the visual speed of the object.
